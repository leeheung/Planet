      is a class of celestial bodies that revolve around a star.<br>
      Generally speaking, a planet is smaller than a brown dwarf,<br>
      but a celestial body with a diameter of thousands of kilometers or more.<br>
      Before the <u>20th century</u>, only eight planets in the solar system were known,<br>
      but at least 200 alien planets are known by 2012 as<br>
      the planets outside the solar system can be observed<br></p><img src="nasa.jpg" width="50%"><p style="margin-top:40px;">
      In general, the planet is said to have been formed by the gathering of dust<br>
      and gaseous matter that circulated around the primitive when the nebula ,<br>
      which is the origin of some stars , collapsed.</p>
